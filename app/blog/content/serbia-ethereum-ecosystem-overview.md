## Tl;dr

- Serbia has become a leading blockchain hub in Eastern Europe, driven by early innovators like MVP Workshop, Tenderly and DeFi Saver, with a strong focus on Ethereum development.
- A dynamic ecosystem thrives through collaboration between startups, grassroots communities, academia, and ventures, with companies actively giving back to foster growth.
- Key players like MVP Workshop and Tenderly lead with cutting-edge Ethereum solutions, supported by a robust developer talent pool skilled in engineering and mathematics.
- Progressive policies, such as the Digital Assets Law create a supportive environment for blockchain innovation.
- Despite government support, Serbian startups face challenges in raising venture capital compared to EU member states, limiting their ability to scale.

## Policy

- Digital Assets Law (2020): Serbia's Law on Digital Assets, effective December 2020 and implemented by mid-2021, legalized cryptocurrency trading, issuance, and mining. It regulates virtual currencies (including Ethereum) and digital tokens, providing legal protection for transactions. The National Bank of Serbia (NBS) oversees virtual currency services, while the Serbian Securities Commission (SSC) handles token investments, ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) rules.
- Taxation: Crypto transactions not involving fiat conversion are VAT-exempt, making Serbia tax-friendly for Ethereum users. Capital gains tax (15%) applies to profits from ETH sales, with deductions available for reinvesting in Serbian companies within 90 days. Mining costs are deductible if documented, but the lack of a standardized tax return form for digital assets has caused minor delays.

## Society and Culture

**Resilience and Innovation**

Serbia's history of economic and political challenges, including 1990s international sanctions, hyperinflation, and restricted access to global payment systems like PayPal and Stripe in their early days, has fostered a resilient, problem-solving culture. Political instability from the Yugoslav wars and slow EU integration pushed developers toward crypto like Ethereum for cross-border transactions, spurring early Web3 innovation. This "underdog mentality", a drive to succeed despite adversity, as noted by [Ivan Bjelajac](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivanbjelajac/?utm_source=localethereum.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=serbia-ethereum-ecosystem-overview), ex-MVP Workshop (now with Tenderly), fuels Serbian developers to create globally competitive solutions from day one.

**Community and Collaboration: Giving It Back**

Serbian culture's emphasis on mutual support during challenging times indirectly shapes its blockchain ecosystem. Events like Belgrade Blockchain Week and ETH Belgrade unite local and global Web3 communities for knowledge-sharing and networking, reflecting values of openness and collaboration. Major players like Tenderly, Decenter, MVP Workshop, and Ethernal actively support the local community through educational programs such as the Petnica Ethereum bootcamp, by mentoring and hiring top mathematics and computer science talents, and by sponsoring grassroots hackathons and conferences like ETH Belgrade. This commitment to community development strengthens Serbia's position as an emerging Ethereum development hub.
