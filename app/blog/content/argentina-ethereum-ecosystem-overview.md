## Ethereum in Argentina: The Early Days

- Early crypto history in Argentina can be traced back to 2011‚Äì2012 when some Bitcoiners started Bitcoin Argentina on Facebook, which later led to the founding of the [Bitcoin Argentina NGO](https://bitcoinargentina.org/sobre-nosotros/) in 2013.
- [Casa Voltaire](https://restofworld.org/2021/rise-and-fall-of-the-house-of-bitcoin/) followed in 2014-2015. Functioning as both a hacker house and hangout spot, Casa Voltaire served as an innovation hub that spawned companies including Decentraland, Muun, and OpenZeppelin.
- The first ETHGlobal hackathon in LATAM was the [ETHBuenosAires](https://ethbuenosaires.com/) back in May 2018, thanks to the organizers [Mart√≠n](https://x.com/0xtoucan) and [Ornella](https://x.com/ornellacordoba).
- For years after ETHBuenosAires, the community [came together](https://ethereumba.substack.com/p/ethereum-ba-recap-2018-2020) to talk and learn at [EthereumBA meetups](https://ethereumba.com/), thanks to [Mart√≠n](https://x.com/0xtoucan), [Sebasti√°n](https://x.com/Saldasoro), Emilio and Mateo.
- Communities like [DeFi Para Principiantes](https://t.me/defiprincipiantes) provided educational onboarding while wallets like Argent were subsidizing gas fees at the time, allowing Argentines who initially adopted DAI as a hedge against inflation to later explore broader DeFi opportunities during strict currency controls.
- [ETHLatam @ Buenos Aires 2022 Recap](https://mirror.xyz/ethlatam.eth/R1x-ALC_7mNHS_Wh2zETtV8dph_dgbwNHEHFnydwIjU): ETHLatam origins. How it started, how it's going. From a ~300 people hackathon to a 4,000+ people conference.

## Inflation, Public Trust

- In 2001, a [measure](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/normativa/nacional/decreto-1570-2001-70355/normas-modifican) known as "El Corralito" limited Argentines' access to their bank deposits, restricting their withdrawals. This event eroded public trust in the government, banks and the economy.
- High inflation has made Argentines acutely aware of [multiple exchange rates](https://buenosairesherald.com/economics/dollar-peso/all-argentinas-dollar-exchange-rates-explained) and the need to save in alternative currencies.
- Since the 2010s, Argentina's strict currency controls, transaction restrictions, and foreign exchange limitations have driven widespread adoption of alternative financial solutions, with citizens increasingly relying on foreign bank accounts, physical US dollars, and more recently, stablecoins for payments, remittances, and wealth preservation.
- In February 2024, President Milei promoted the launch of the '$LIBRA' cryptocurrency, which crashed by more than 90% after an initial spike. This collapse wiped out over $280 million in value and damaged Milei's image. Lawmakers [continue to investigate](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/es/articles/67f5fc671cab7401f52bc387/) the government's involvement.

## Policy

- Traditional banks [cannot provide crypto services in Argentina](https://www.bcra.gob.ar/pdfs/comytexord/A7506.pdf). However, CEXs can provide crypto services given they are listed as Virtual Asset Service Providers. Crypto payments are not prohibited, but remain a "grey area."
- Earnings obtained from buying and selling virtual assets are understood as capital gains, should be declared and are subject to [statements of personal assets, taxes on personal assets](https://biblioteca.afip.gob.ar/dcp/DID_K_000002_2022_06_16) and income taxes, both individually and as a company.
- Crypto regulation is progressing under the new administration.
  - [Law 27.743](https://www.boletinoficial.gob.ar/detalleAviso/primera/310191/20240708) marked the first explicit regulatory inclusion of crypto.
  - [Law 27.739](https://www.boletinoficial.gob.ar/detalleAviso/primera/304764/20240315) defined virtual assets and created a [Virtual Asset Service Providers registry](https://www.cnv.gov.ar/SitioWeb/ProveedoresServiciosActivosVirtuales/RegistrosPSAV).
- Recently, Argentina's crypto community has engaged with [initiatives by the Argentine Fintech Chamber to create a regulatory sandbox](https://camarafintech.org/propuesta-de-sandbox-regulatorio-para-la-tokenizacion-de-rwa/) to explore tokenization of RWA.

- **Stablecoin surge**: In Argentina, stablecoins accounted for 61.8% of all crypto activities. Due to high inflation (reaching [211%](https://www.indec.gob.ar/uploads/informesdeprensa/ipc_01_24DBD5D8158C.pdf) in 2023 and [118%](https://www.indec.gob.ar/uploads/informesdeprensa/ipc_01_2517A7124C09.pdf) in 2024) and Peso devaluation, stablecoins provide an alternative way for people to protect their savings. Stablecoin-based remittances are gaining traction in Argentina and LATAM as a whole.
- **On and offramps**: Locals prefer CEXs like Lemon ‚Äì [46.9% of daily active users in exchanges choosing Argentine platforms in 2024](https://www.lemon.me/reportecrypto2024.pdf). Argentines rely on CEXs and informal exchanges with parallel non-official exchange rates for onramp and offramp solutions.
- **DID**: QuarkID is the digital trust framework developed by the Government of the City of Buenos Aires that establishes a new digital identity system, providing enhanced privacy for 3.6 million citizens.
