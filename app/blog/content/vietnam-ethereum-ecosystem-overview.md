Special thanks to Jade Hoang, Kim Trong, Phuc Thai, Trong Nguyen, Sasha Mai, and Tuyen for the feedback and the review.

## **TL;DR**

- **Adoption paradox:** Vietnam ranks #4 globally in Chainalysis's adoption index despite legal restrictions on crypto payments, largely organic and retail-driven.
- **Notable projects:** Kyber, Pendle, Axie Infinity, Orochi Network, NE (previously Coin98), Coin68, etc.
- **Gaming-driven engagement:** Play-to-earn games like Axie Infinity catalyzed massive retail onboarding (2020–2022).
- **Developer dynamics:** Strong dev talent, but many work for outsourcing companies; Vietnamese builders on Ethereum often operate outside large, visible communities.
- **Regulatory uncertainty**: Despite ongoing regulatory uncertainty and prohibited crypto payments, Vietnam shows early openness through its new Digital Technology Law (June 2025, effective January 2026) and IFC sandbox initiative.
- **Comprehensive ecosystem:** DeFi/GameFi/infra startups (Kyber, Pendle, Axie, Orochi), venture capital (Kyros Ventures, Caliber, Coin98 Ventures), academic cryptography research (VIASM, HCMUT, HUST, VNU, ZKP Labs), media (Coin68, Coin98 Insights), and enterprise players (FPT, SotaTek).
- **ZKP/cryptography foundation:** Positioned as Southeast Asia's premier crypto development hub with notable strength in zero-knowledge research.
- **Infrastructure focus:** Early Vietnamese teams built L1s (when L2s were nascent); more recent projects have shifted toward L2 and application-layer development.

## 1. Adoption Metrics

- Global Rankings:
  - [Chainalysis 2025 Global Crypto Adoption Index](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2025-global-crypto-adoption-index/): 4th globally, up from 5th (2024), down from 3rd (2022)
  - [TRM Labs 2025 Country Crypto Adoption Index](https://www.trmlabs.com/reports-and-whitepapers/2025-crypto-adoption-and-stablecoin-usage-report): 7th globally, down from 5th (2024)

## 2. **Why Vietnam’s crypto adoption is so high**

- **Limited productive investment options meet high savings rate:** Vietnam has one of Asia's highest savings rates at 25-30% of GDP, but people have limited good options. The stock market is volatile and retail-dominated. Capital controls make investing abroad difficult.
- **Frictionless access and regulatory gray zone:** Crypto infrastructure just works in Vietnam. Binance and major exchanges operate smoothly, on-ramps are simple, and you can start with just a few dollars. While the domestic stock market runs on T+2 settlement, crypto's 24/7 trading and volatility appeal to retail traders. Crucially, the regulatory environment is a gray zone - not banned like China, not fully legitimized - which lets people use crypto freely without barriers or institutional gatekeeping.
- **Appeal to young growth-seekers:** The crypto adopters are predominantly young, mobile-native millennials and Gen Z (not the traditional gold buyers or conservative investors). With a median age of [33.5](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/field/median-age/country-comparison/), a population of [102.3 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam#cite_note-gso-pop-12), and [84%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.NET.USER.ZS?locations=VN) internet penetration, the demographic conditions favor digital asset adoption among those drawn to crypto's high-return potential over more conventional options.
- **Proven builder ecosystem through DeFi and GameFi:** High-profile successes like Loi Luu's Kyber Network and Trung Nguyen's Axie Infinity showed Vietnamese founders a path to wealth, inspiring many to follow. While Axie's user boom during COVID happened mainly in the Philippines, the Vietnamese-founded project sparked a wave of local GameFi development in 2021, some finding decent success before the sector died off. These wins proved that local teams could build globally relevant products, attracting serious technical talent to the space.

## 3. Regulatory Landscape: **Shift From Grey Market to Regulated Crypto Industry**

Vietnam's cryptocurrency regulation shifted decisively in 2025 from legal ambiguity to controlled legitimization. Historically, since 2017 it prohibited crypto as payment while leaving trading and ownership legally undefined, which can create a massive shadow economy.

The breakthrough came June 14, 2025, when the [Law on Digital Technology Industry](https://insightplus.bakermckenzie.com/bm/data-technology/vietnam-digital-technology-law-legal-foundations-and-strategic-incentives-to-accelerate-digital-economic-growth?ref=ghost.fystack.io) recognized digital assets as “property” under the Civil Code for the first time (effective January 1, 2026), though crypto remains NOT legal tender.

Resolution 05/2025/NQ-CP (September 9, 2025) operationalized a five-year pilot with strict requirements: exchanges need VND 10,000 billion minimum capital (~$378M USD), 65% institutional ownership, [49% foreign ownership cap,](https://www.theblock.co/post/386543/vietnam-opens-crypto-exchange-licensing) and Ministry of Finance licensing. Only Vietnamese enterprises can issue real asset-backed crypto assets. Foreign investor participation is restricted, and the same tax regime as securities transactions temporarily applies (e.g., 0.1% on transaction value).

**Impact:** 

- Policy prioritizes institutional control, FATF compliance, and user protection, favoring stability and fraud prevention over capital inflows and investor enthusiasm.
- Traders & Users: Legal recognition of digital assets as property boosts legitimacy and combats scams, with domestic/foreign users able to trade via MOF/IFC-licensed CASPs (post-6-month grace period); mandatory AML/KYC, 0.1% transaction taxes, and penalties curb P2P/grey-market activity, enhancing security but restricting informal volumes.
- Startup founders: cannot access exchange licensing due to the VND 10T (~$378M) capital barrier or conduct traditional ICOs, as token issuances require licensed platforms only. Local Vietnamese GameFi projects and devshops face shutdown pressure, several have already suspended services early this year, unable to meet compliance demands.
- Investors see clarity and limits
  - Investors (Foreign): The 49% foreign ownership cap plus data localization requirements under [Decree 53](https://vanban.chinhphu.vn/?pageid=27160&docid=206381&ref=ghost.fystack.io) mandating user data stored within Vietnam means you can't just parachute in, you’ll need local [Joint Venture](https://cafef.vn/7-ong-lon-chinh-thuc-gia-nhap-cuoc-dua-lam-san-giao-dich-tai-san-ma-hoa-viet-nam-he-lo-dong-thai-tung-ben-188250925230424644.chn) structures and onshore infrastructure.
- This reinforces the existing pattern: incorporate in Singapore for regulatory clarity and capital access, operate teams in Vietnam for talent and market proximity.
- It gives room for innovation under Resolution No. 222/2025 on International Financial Centers, e.g., Members can conduct transactions such as payments, transfers with each other and with foreign entities.

## **5. Institutional & Public Sector Adoption**

### Banking & Finance

- Vietnamese banks are not crypto-friendly, though bankers are generally open-minded toward blockchain technology. Major banks (Vietcombank, BIDV, etc.) do not support crypto transactions.
- P2P transfers are permitted, but banks internally flag transactions containing keywords like "crypto" or "bitcoin" for monitoring - particularly if linked to suspicious fund sources. This is informal bank policy rather than official government regulation (confirmed via banking contacts). Accounts can be frozen at police request for money laundering investigations, not crypto activity per se.
- The core issue: Vietnam lacks licensed on/off-ramps, pushing users to P2P and informal OTC channels where fund provenance is harder to verify. Legitimate traders risk getting caught up when counterparties have tainted funds.
- Real-World Assets (RWA): Not an active sector yet.
- Despite crypto restrictions, Vietnamese banks are actively deploying blockchain use cases:
  - [Vietcombank](https://www.vietcombank.com.vn): Applied blockchain to Letters of Credit, cutting processing [from 3-5 days to 27 minutes](https://www.business.hsbc.com.vn/en-gb/campaigns/innovation-digital-transformation/client-case).
  - [VietinBank](https://www.vietinbank.de): Streamlined the duration of both domestic and international interbank transactions from 5-7 working days to just 24 hours through blockchain implementation.
  - [TPBank](https://tpb.vn/eng/ve-tpbank): The first bank to successfully implement international money transfers via Blockchain through RippleNet.
  - [Techcombank](<https://www.tcbs.com.vn/ve-chung-toi/blockchain-tcbs/#:~:text=TCBS%20%C4%91%C3%A3%20ghi%20d%E1%BA%A5u%20%E1%BA%A5n%20ti%C3%AAn%20phong,(Blockchain%2Denable%20Bond)%20v%C3%A0%20qu%E1%BA%A3n%20l%C3%BD%20h%E1%BB%87%20th%E1%BB%91ng>): Through its subsidiary TCBS, successfully implemented blockchain technology in [bond management](https://www.tcbs.com.vn/documents/10181/0/AN-TCBS-2024_compres.pdf) (Blockchain-enabled Bond) and iXu reward point system (Blockchain-enabled iXu).

### **Corporate/Enterprise**

Limited exploration of public blockchain (including Ethereum) due to legal concerns

- [FPT Group](https://fptsoftware.com) (tech conglomerate): Enterprise blockchain focus, primarily Hyperledger.
- [SotaTek](https://www.sotatek.com): IT services and consulting firm, a subsidiary of Sota Holdings.

### Government - [**NDAChain**](https://ndachain.vn/en)

- 49 public-private validator nodes; average of 1,200 TPS.
- Developed by National Data Association; operated by Data Innovation and Exploitation Center (under Ministry of Public Security).
- Products: NDA DID (decentralized identity for verifying counterparties, integrated with VNeID), NDATrace (product verification and traceability), and NDAKey (quick identity authentication app).
- Goal: Build Vietnam's sovereign digital infrastructure, the verification layer for e-government, finance, healthcare, and logistics, ensuring data security, transparency, and trust.

## **6. Investment Landscape**

Vietnam's crypto investment scene has cooled since new regulations cracked down on ICOs, IDOs, and scam projects, making token launches explicitly illegal, previously a gray area where rug pulls went largely unpunished.

Post-regulation, participants in scam projects (especially GameFi teams) face lawsuits, with many cases emerging since January; VCs investing in dubious projects can still profit but risk legal exposure if unaware of fraud.

### **Local VCs**

- **Coin98 Ventures**: Active local crypto VC with 100+ portfolio companies
- **Kyros Ventures**: Early-stage incubator backed by Coin68 ecosystem, produces market research
- **Kyber Ventures**: Investment arm of Kyber Group, supporting DeFi ecosystem
- **Caliber**: Web3 venture builder by Kyber Network

### International Funding

Most Vietnamese crypto startups raise from Singapore/US VCs. Vietnamese projects have attracted funding from Animoca Brands, Binance Labs, Pantera Capital, Hashed, Alameda Research (pre-collapse).

## **7. Developer Events & Education**

### Developer & Builder Community

- Vietnam ranks 8th globally for new blockchain developer share (3%), alongside Germany, Indonesia, China, Canada, and Turkey, trailing only India (22%) and the US (14%)
- Strong talent in gaming/frontend, cryptography and security, weaker in protocol development
- A significant portion of Vietnam's local software developers work for outsourcing giants like [FPT](https://fptsoftware.com), [TMA](https://www.tmasolutions.com), [CMC Global](https://cmcglobal.com.vn) and [KMS](https://kms-technology.com), which dominate the IT sector.
- Best developers often relocate or work remotely for foreign companies. Those staying in Vietnam tend to maintain a low profile

### **Communities and events**

- [ETHVietnam](https://www.eth-vietnam.com): Annual hackathon/conference (started 2023)
- [GM Vietnam](https://gmvietnam.io): Vietnam Blockchain Week, Multi-chain event
- [Super Vietnam](https://supervietnam.com/): Blockchain, RWA & AI Week - tradefi and crypto enterprises focus
- [Conviction](https://2026.conviction.vn): Vietnam Digital Asset Economy Forum
- [Web3 Builders' Summit](https://www.web3builderssummit.com): Annually summit held in Da Nang since 2024, gathers founders and developers to discuss blockchain and AI integration
- Other communities include Web3 Saigon, sqrDAO, APAC DAO, though activity has declined. Various L2 groups (Starknet VN, Scroll VN) became less active after the ICO era. Base appears to be the most active L2 community currently.

### **University engagement**

Education gap: Few universities offer blockchain-specific courses. Most of the devs are self taught through online course.

- Vietnam National University (Hanoi): Occasional blockchain courses
- RMIT Vietnam: [Fintech program](https://www.rmit.edu.vn/about-us/schools-and-centres/the-business-school/fintech-crypto-hub/courses) touches on blockchain
- Key universities targeted by crypto companies for talent recruitment:
  - Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT)
  - Hanoi University of Science and Technology
  - Ho Chi Minh City University of Science (HCMUS)
  - VNU Hanoi University of Science (VNU-HUS)
  - VNU University of Engineering and Technology (VNU-UET)
  - Da Nang University of Science and Technology (DUT)
- [**VIASM**](https://viasm.edu.vn/en/home/) (Vietnam Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics) is a premier research institute that has hosted IACR-VIASM [Summer Schools on Cryptography](https://viasm.edu.vn/en/hdkh/IACR-VIASM-School-2022) (2016, 2022) focusing on lattice-based cryptography and Zero-Knowledge Proofs, connecting Vietnamese mathematicians with the global cryptography community. It serves as a critical academic foundation for Vietnam's blockchain and ZKP talent pipeline, a schelling point for local zk builders! ✨

## 8. Regional Hubs

Vietnam's blockchain activity centers on three cities: **Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon)** serves as the primary development hub, **Hanoi** is key for government relations/ policy and uni, and **Da Nang** is emerging as a tech city with sandbox initiatives.

## 9. Challenges

- **Uncertain Policy → New Framework, Uncertain Implementation:** Previously, the absence of a clear legal framework discouraged VC investment and deterred top talent. While the Law on Digital Technology Industry (effective Jan 1, 2026) and Decision 96/QD-BTC (effective Jan 20, 2026) have finally opened a licensing pathway, the "uncertainty" has transitioned into execution risk. The primary challenge is whether these official platforms can offer the variety and depth required to keep users from returning to the now "legally high-risk" gray market. For local startups, particularly those building DeFi or DEX infrastructure, the regulatory stance can make their work more difficult (harder to attract VCs, harder to conduct an ICO, harder to hire top talent…)
- **The "Trust Deficit" & Brand Dilution:** High-profile scams have left lasting skepticism among both users and policymakers. For users, this creates a much higher barrier for trusting new, local projects. For policymakers, this history has driven a "permission-first" regulatory approach. However, the new policy targeting scammers is a positive signal; it provides a protective floor for users and legitimate local players like **Kyber Network**, which may eventually unlock the ecosystem’s full potential.
- **Talent Pipeline & Developer Barriers:**
  - Vietnam has a strong technical foundation, but growth is limited by market perception and opportunity.
  - Compared to established fields like Gaming or AI, blockchain currently offers fewer stable career paths. Vietnamese developers are practical; they gravitate toward industries with clear professional progression.
  - Crypto’s scam-heavy reputation further discourages elite developers who want to protect their professional standing.
  - Furthermore, formal blockchain education is limited, and the dominance of English-language documentation creates a steep learning curve for local talent.
  - The result: a) Founders incorporate offshore to mitigate legal uncertainty. b) Developers work for foreign firms that pay significantly more.
- **User Education & Use Case Gap:** Education is "trade-centric." Most users stay within the safety of CEXs, lacking the technical literacy to use self-custody or on-chain protocols. DeFi really works, but many users are looking for short-term gains. Real world use cases like remittance demand exists, but crypto off-ramp costs remain uncompetitive against traditional services like Wise. Startups lack incentive to build utility-focused products when user demand centers on quick trading gains.
