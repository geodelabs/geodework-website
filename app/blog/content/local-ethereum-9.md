## Latam 💃

- LatAm is emerging as a powerful crypto hub with nearly $1.5 trillion in transaction volume from mid-2022 to mid-2025. Economic volatility, inflation, and capital controls fuel demand for stablecoins as a store of value and vehicle for cross-border payments.
- **Brazil** Leads the Region: Brazil [dominates LatAm](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/latin-america-crypto-adoption-2025/) with $318 billion in crypto flows in 2025, driven by stablecoin use for payments and remittances, innovation through its Pix instant payment system, and the blockchain-based Drex pilot. Institutional adoption is strong, with banks like Itaú, Mercado Pago, and Nubank integrating crypto products backed by clear regulations that foster secure growth. Learn more about [Brazil Ethereum Ecosystem](https://localethereum.beehiiv.com/p/brazil-ethereum-ecosystem-overview).
- **Argentina**:
  - [Crecimiento](https://x.com/crecimientoar): The Aleph Festival (Aug 25–Nov 22) in Buenos Aires hosts LatAm‘s largest Web3 hackathon, [a 6-week Buildathon Season](https://buildathonseason.notion.site), and prepares startups for the Devconnect Startup World Cup. The festival accelerates Argentina’s Ethereum ecosystem through hands-on support, protocol-aligned tracks, demos, workshops, and community events around Ethereum and Layer 2.
  - [ETHKipu](https://x.com/ETHKipu): ETHKipu continues to expand the Ethereum Developer Pack while also organizing ETHLatam, one of the region’s largest Ethereum conference and hackathon, set to bring together builders and communities from across LatAm.
  - [SEEDOrg](https://x.com/SEEDLatam): SEEDOrg’s 2025 highlights include the first University Day at Devconnect Buenos Aires with 25+ universities engaged and a nationwide tour onboarding 1,500+ builders. SeedOrg fosters blockchain adoption through government and enterprise partnerships, runs an independent ETH validator, and trains node operators in Distributed Validator Technology across seven LatAm countries.
  - [Odisea Labs](https://x.com/odisealabs): recently announced the launch of [Núcleo](https://x.com/odisealabs/status/1966187466882179304), an immersive platform for LatAm and global builders to make the leap onchain. Núcleo offers learning by building, a vibrant community, real opportunities, $2,500 USD in Buildathon prizes, 24/7 AI tutors, and onchain certifications on Base.

## Africa 🦁

- [Sub-Saharan Africa is now the third-fastest-growing crypto region globally](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/subsaharan-africa-crypto-adoption-2025/), with over $205 billion in on-chain value from July 2024 to June 2025, a 52% increase year-over-year. Nigeria leads with $92.1 billion in transactions, driven by inflation and restricted foreign currency access, pushing many to use stablecoins as a dollar substitute. The region’s crypto growth highlights real-world use cases, from inflation hedging to cross-border payments, amid regulatory and infrastructural challenges.

# **Global Ecosystem Update 🗺️**

- Scale L1 & L2: [Ethereum Fusaka Upgrade](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/09/26/fusaka-testnet-announcement#how-do-ethereum-network-upgrades-work): Scheduled for mainnet launch on December 3, 2025, Fusaka will significantly increase Ethereum’s block gas limit from 45M to 150M and introduce Peer Data Availability Sampling (PeerDAS) to reduce costs for Layer 2s and validators. A four-week security audit contest offers $2 million in rewards to uncover bugs before launch.
- [Improve UX through two parallel tracks](https://notes.ethereum.org/@rudolf/interop-13):
  1. **Intent layer foundations:** Standardizing intent layer (e.g., Open Intents Framework + extensions), allowing users to define desired outcomes rather than craft transactions. Protocols like Permit3 handle cross-chain approvals with single signatures, while Axal manages intent execution abstracting gas, batching, and multi-chain complexity.
  2. **Faster Settlement & Reduced Latency**
  - **L1 finality**: FSF achieving 12-second finality (vs 16 min), enabling faster L2 state proof verification for interop.
  - **L2 withdrawals**: Research into reducing 7-day challenge periods to 1 day while maintaining censorship resistance.
  - “**SNARK-ify everything**” as proofs get cheaper; design with ZK in mind.
- Privacy: Ethereum Foundation sets end-to-end privacy roadmap, with private writes, reads and proving. Check out the [PSE roadmap: 2025 and beyond](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/pse-roadmap-2025-and-beyond/25423)! At the same time, the Privacy Cluster announced a [new leadership structure](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/10/01/privacy-cluster-leads) with Igor Mandrigin and Andy Guzman being appointed as co-leads to drive coordination across privacy initiatives and accelerate deployment of privacy-preserving technologies into production.
- Payment: Swift announced it is adding a [blockchain-based shared ledger](https://www.swift.com/news-events/press-releases/swift-add-blockchain-based-ledger-its-infrastructure-stack-groundbreaking-move-accelerate-and-scale-benefits-digital-finance) to its global infrastructure, collaborating with over 30 banks to enable instant, 24/7 cross-border payments across 200+ countries. As part of this initiative, Swift is piloting migration of interbank messaging processes onto [Ethereum Layer 2 Linea](https://consensys.io/blog/consensys-scaling-decentralized-finance) by ConsenSys, highlighting growing institutional adoption of Ethereum L2 scalable settlement rails.
- Institutional: The [Ether Machine filed with the SEC](https://www.theblock.co/post/371005/the-ether-machine-files-s4) to go public via a merger, signaling growing institutional activity around Ethereum assets.
- Others: Ethereum Foundation [formed the ‘dAI’ team](https://x.com/DavideCrapis/status/1967573374911340975) to position Ethereum as the foundational base layer for the AI economy, with ongoing work on privacy roadmaps including private writes, reads, and proofs.
