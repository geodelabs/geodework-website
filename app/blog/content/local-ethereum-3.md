## Tl;dr

- Community ownership and volunteer spirit make Taiwan's Ethereum ecosystem unique, where people value digital democracy and open source.
- Many local OGs in the Ethereum R&D space are still active in the ecosystem. They serve as stewards of its values, while also onboarding newcomers to the space.

## Policy

- Taiwan does not recognize cryptocurrencies as legal currency. The Central Bank and Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) consider cryptocurrencies to be speculative "virtual commodities" rather than currencies. Banks are prohibited from accepting Bitcoin or providing crypto-related services, and credit card companies cannot process crypto purchases.
- The FSC established AML guidelines for VASPs in 2023, with regulations officially starting January 2025 and registration required by September 2025. A comprehensive cryptocurrency law enabling stablecoin issuance and new trading rules is scheduled for June 2025. The regulatory framework's feasibility study concluded in late 2024, with legislation now progressing through the system.

## Values, Culture, and Digital Democracy

- Taiwan's digital democracy, led by Minister [Audrey Tang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Tang), uses technology to heal polarization and increase transparency, raising public trust from 9% to about 60%. Their approach features open-source tools, pro-social networks, and citizen deliberation processes that address challenges from AI deepfakes to cryptocurrency regulation, with Tang serving on the RadicalxChange Foundation board alongside Ethereum founder [Vitalik Buterin](https://x.com/VitalikButerin).
- While the government treats cryptocurrencies as "virtual commodities" with comprehensive taxation, Taiwan's model represents a middle path between [AI-powered authoritarianism and blockchain-fueled libertarianism](https://time.com/6979012/audrey-tang-interview-plurality-democracy/), showing how technology and democracy can thrive together rather than in opposition.
- "g0v" (gov-zero): A decentralized civic tech community with information transparency, open results and open cooperation as its core values. The community embraces innovative approaches to civic participation and decision-making, including experiments with mechanisms like Quadratic Funding and Quadratic Voting.
- Open source culture: Taiwan has a vibrant and active open source ecosystem with organizations like Open Culture Foundation (OCF), COSCUP (Conference for Open Source Coders, Users & Promoters), g0v, MozTW, etc. Local Ethereum Communities like Taiwan Ethereum Meetup group actively support and sometimes organize Blockchain and Ethereum tracks at COSCUP.

Taiwan has more than 1.27 million developers, with many top talents gravitating toward semiconductor giants like TSMC, manufacturing leaders like Foxconn, and chip designers like MediaTek. These companies provide abundant job opportunities for graduates, while web3 positions remain comparatively limited on the island.

### 2. Ethereum devs
- Core devs & researchers: Taiwan has produced exceptional builders like Hsiao-Wei Wang from Taipei, who served as Consensus R&D team lead at Ethereum Foundation and now works as a managing director at the Ethereum Foundation.
