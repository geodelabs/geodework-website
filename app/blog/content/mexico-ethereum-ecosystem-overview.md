## 🇲🇽 How Ethereum Is Powering Mexico’s Remittance Transformation?

![banner-mexico-2.png](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,quality=80,format=auto,onerror=redirect/uploads/asset/file/ed2d2470-19ce-4056-a6f0-1b3336770a15/banner-mexico-deep-dive.png)

Special thanks to Ana Belén, Don Pepe and Abraham FuGa for the feedback and the review.  

## **TL;DR**

- Mexico is among Latin America's fastest-growing crypto markets, ranking 13th-14th globally in adoption, driven by a unique combination of high remittance flows ($64.7B in 2024), financial inclusion needs, and a young tech-savvy population.
- The U.S.-Mexico remittance corridor, the world's largest, has become a proving ground for crypto innovation. Platforms like Bitso processed over [$6.5 billion in crypto-based transfers in 2024, representing more than 10% of total corridor volume](https://business.bitso.com/en/blog/stablecoins-in-action-the-new-financial-edge-for-global-enterprises).
- Mexico's Ethereum community is rapidly maturing, with growing university blockchain clubs, developer education initiatives reaching students, institutions and governments integrating Ethereum and emerging local projects focused on DeFi, stablecoins, and cross-border payments.

## **The Economic Foundation: Remittances as Catalyst**

Mexico stands as the world's second-largest recipient of remittances after India, with $64.7 billion received in 2024, roughly [3.7%](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/BX.TRF.PWKR.DT.GD.ZS?locations=MX) of the nation's GDP. These transfers are a critical lifeline for millions of households, especially in poorer states.

The U.S.-Mexico corridor dominates global remittance flows, and the cost of sending money has historically been high. Traditional channels charge [slightly below 5% for a $200 transfer](https://www.dallasfed.org/banking/pubs/dfb/2025/2504-dunbar-remit). This inefficiency has created massive opportunity for crypto-based alternatives.

Crypto has emerged as a cost-effective solution, with stablecoin transfers costing as little as [~$0.02 on-chain](https://l2fees.info) (depends on the network and can fluctuate based on network activity), though total fees (including conversion to local currency) typically range from [0.5-3%](https://www.fgveurope.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Research-Study-Emily-Ekshian.pdf) depending on the corridor and platform. For example, Bitso processed [$3.3 billion](https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/05/03/how-crypto-can-reshape-the-130-billion-remittance-market-in-latin-america/) in remittances from the U.S. to Mexico in 2022 with transaction fees of less than 1%, up from $2 billion in 2021. Stablecoins like USDT and USDC have become the most practical vehicles for these transactions, offering dollar stability without the volatility of traditional crypto.

## **Financial Inclusion Gap**

Approximately [45%](https://www.bbvaresearch.com/en/publicaciones/mexico-financial-inclusion-of-households-or-adults-in-mexico/) of Mexican adults lack access to traditional banking services, according to various estimates. This massive unbanked population represents both a challenge and an opportunity for blockchain-based financial services. For many Mexicans, crypto wallets provide their first real access to digital financial infrastructure.

The combination of high remittance volumes, significant financial exclusion, and tech-savvy youth has made Mexico fertile ground for crypto adoption as practical financial infrastructure, not just a speculative asset.

## Regulatory Landscape: Conservative Framework, Innovative Workarounds

Mexico was a regional pioneer with its 2018 Fintech Law (Ley para Regular las Instituciones de Tecnología Financiera), one of Latin America's first comprehensive frameworks for digital financial services.

### **Key Regulatory Features**

**Legal but Not Legal Tender**: Virtual assets are legally recognized under the Fintech Law but explicitly not considered legal tender. 

**Banking Restrictions:** In 2019, Banco de México (Banxico) issued Circular 4/2019, effectively prohibiting financial institutions (banks and regulated fintechs) from offering crypto services to the public. They can only conduct "internal operations" with virtual assets, and only after obtaining prior authorization from Banxico.

**Non-Financial Entity Space:** The regulations created an opening for non-financial entities (like Bitso) to operate exchanges and custody services, subject to strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements.

**Taxation:** As of 2025, Mexico has not yet implemented a dedicated tax framework for crypto-assets. Crypto profits are subject to income tax ([up to 35% for individuals, 30% for corporations)](https://www.globallegalinsights.com/practice-areas/blockchain-cryptocurrency-laws-and-regulations/mexico/). Capital gains under 90,000 pesos may be tax-exempt. 

### **CBDC Development**

In 2021, Banxico first [announced plans](https://x.com/GobiernoMX/status/1476376240873517061) to issue a Mexican peso Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) by 2024 to promote financial inclusion, but progress has stalled and updates remain scarce. In April 2024, [Banxico joined the BIS-led Project Agorá](https://www.banxico.org.mx/publicaciones-y-prensa/miscelaneos/{5D8D0806-0899-C31B-2971-FDEB10D1BDCE}.pdf) to explore tokenized deposits and wholesale digital money for cross-border payments. The project is experimental and aims to report initial findings by the first half of 2026.

### **Regional and Governmental Innovation**

Despite the lack of top-down national policy, subnational governments and legislative bodies have begun experimenting with blockchain technology, especially using Ethereum and ZK-based infrastructure for transparency, identity, and citizen-service use cases.

- **Nuevo León:**
    
    The state, Mexico’s second-largest economy and a leading technology hub, has launched [NLinea](https://www.nl.gob.mx/es/nlinea), a Decentralized Digital Identity (DID) platform for citizens. Built on [Sovra](http://sovra.io), a blockchain developed with the Ethrex stack on Ethereum, NLinea creates a verifiable, privacy-preserving digital ID system to streamline access to public services and reduce fraud.
    
- **Mexico City & Other Regions:**
    
    The Cámara de Diputados (Chamber of Deputies) has hosted a series of educational sessions, policy roundtables, and public forums focused on blockchain’s potential for transparency, procurement, and digital governance. 
    

## Market Dynamics: Adoption Beyond Hype

### **Scale of Adoption**

- **User Base:** Estimated [15 million crypto users](https://cryptoforinnovation.org/why-theres-more-to-mexican-crypto-than-remittances/) by 2025, representing 10.1-12% of Mexico's population (129.7 million)
- **Demographics:** [37% of crypto investors are aged 25-34](https://blog.bitso.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/110325_FINAL-FINAL-INFORME_BITSO_ingles.pdf), with 22% each in the 18-24 and 35-44 age groups. 74% of users are men, 26% women

### **Local Stablecoins**

In recent years, multiple projects have launched **Peso-pegged stablecoins (MXN-backed)** to bridge Mexico’s traditional financial system with onchain liquidity. These tokens aim to enable faster **cross-border payments, remittances, and yield-bearing DeFi products** denominated in the local currency.

- **Arbitrum x Bitso – [MXNB](https://mxnb.mx/en-US)**
    
    A collaboration between Bitso (the leading LATAM exchange) and Arbitrum to launch **MXNB**, a peso-backed stablecoin fully collateralized 1:1 with MXN. MXNB aims to facilitate **onchain payments, payroll, and remittances**, leveraging Bitso’s fiat rails and Arbitrum’s scalable infrastructure.
    
- **[Etherfuse](https://x.com/etherfuse) x Base – [MXNe](https://www.etherfuse.com/blogs/etherfuse-r-introduces-real-mxn-mxne-stablecoin-on-solana-base-and-stellar)**
    
    Etherfuse introduced **MXNe** on Coinbase’s Layer-2 Base (as well as Solana and Stellar), combining local-currency exposure with institutional compliance. The token is designed for on-chain payments, remittances, and payroll
    
- **Tether ([MXNT](https://tether.to/en/transparency/?tab=mxnt))**
    
    Launched in 2022 as Tether’s expansion into emerging markets. Despite Tether’s brand strength, **MXNT adoption remains small**, largely due to limited DeFi integrations and preference for USD-pegged liquidity pairs.
    

### **Use Cases**

**Remittances:** The killer app. Crypto-based transfers are faster and cheaper than Western Union or wire transfers. Bitso alone processed over $6.5 billion in remittances in 2024, which is more than 10% of the total U.S.-Mexico corridor.

**Dollar Access:** Stablecoins provide a way to hold dollars without relying on banks that may impose currency controls or unfavorable exchange rates during volatile periods. During the pandemic, crypto markets acted as efficient forex markets when banks had enormous spreads.

**Freelance & Remote Work:** Mexico's tech workforce increasingly receives compensation in crypto, especially stablecoins, from global clients. This is particularly common among developers and digital professionals.

**Investment & Trading:** Beyond utility, many Mexicans use crypto for speculation and portfolio diversification. Bitcoin remains the most held asset ([~50% of portfolios](https://blog.bitso.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/110325_FINAL-FINAL-INFORME_BITSO_ingles.pdf)), but stablecoins captured [34%](https://blog.bitso.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/110325_FINAL-FINAL-INFORME_BITSO_ingles.pdf) of purchases in 2024 (up 6% YoY).

## Grassroots & Community: Growing but Early Stage

### **Developer Scale & Momentum**

Mexico has approximately [1.9 million developers with 21% YoY growth in 2024](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/), making it one of the fastest-growing dev communities in Latin America. While the blockchain-focused subset remains small compared to Brazil, momentum is accelerating through university clubs, regional hacker houses, and builder collectives.

International Contributions: Mexican builders are actively contributing to global Ethereum projects including Ethereum Foundation (All Core Devs), Arbitrum, Optimism, Uniswap, Base, and others, strengthening Mexico's presence in the broader Web3 ecosystem.

### **Community Infrastructure**

![image.png](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,quality=80,format=auto,onerror=redirect/uploads/asset/file/6efecbef-5e31-406c-b913-75af9cafbadb/mexico-5.png)

Mexico's Ethereum community has grown education-first and grassroots, driven by university students, Spanish-language creators, and regional organizers rather than top-down VC funding.

- [Ethereum México](https://ethmexico.org): An organization dedicated to promoting Ethereum adoption, education, and events in Mexico. It organizes University Blockchain Days, Builders Days, events with Fintech organizations and the yearly flagship conference and hackathon, ETH México.
- Regional Nodes: Regional chapters: [Ethereum Monterrey](https://www.ethmty.org/) (infrastructure/enterprise) and [Ethereum Veracruz](https://x.com/ETH_Veracruz) (university-focused).
- Others:
    - Content & Education: [Espacio Cripto](https://www.espaciocripto.io/) runs Latin America's leading Spanish blockchain podcast.
    - Builders: [Frutero](https://x.com/fruteroclub) organizes technical workshops. [ETH Cinco de Mayo](https://ethcdm.com/) organize hackathons. [HERDAO Mexico](https://x.com/HerDao_Mexico) drives female participation. [CryptoUNAM](https://x.com/Cripto_UNAM) anchors activity at Mexico's top university. [Mexico Tech Week](https://www.mexicotechweek.mx/) is one of Mexico City’s largest tech events, attracting local Web3 builders and hackers.
    - Institutional: [Bitso's Stablecoin Conference](https://business.bitso.com/stablecoin-conference-june-2026) bridges grassroots builders with institutional players.

### **Highlighted Education Initiatives**

Leading Mexican universities are introducing blockchain education, though most programs remain introductory. Notable initiatives include:

- [UNAM](https://dec.fca.unam.mx/Criptoactivos-Blockchain-2023.php) offers faculty courses through FCA Educación Continua, while student club [CriptoUNAM](https://x.com/Cripto_UNAM) drives campus workshops. [Tecnológico de Monterrey](https://prepanet.tec.mx/es/porsiempreprepanet/diplomas-en-blockchain) pioneered blockchain-secured diplomas and offers online programs. [ITAM](https://gonzo.itam.mx/Temario/Cursos/Introduccion_a_Blockchain_y_sus_Aplicaciones_VL.pdf) runs executive courses on blockchain applications with detailed public syllabi. These institutions also serve as key target schools for Web3 hiring.
- [Universidad Veracruzana](https://www.uv.mx/edu-cont/general/curso-blockchain-desarrollo-de-aplicaciones-descentralizadas-dapps-y-contratos-inteligentes/) stands out as the birthplace of Ethereum Veracruz (led by CJ Valdez), offering hands-on courses in DApps and smart contracts alongside regular student hackathons.
- Additional programs: [UIA](https://www.diplomados.ibero.mx/Programas/Detalle-de-programa.aspx?a%C3%B1o=2025&id=585), [Anáhuac](https://online.anahuac.mx/diplomados-en-linea/informatica/blockchain/), [UVM](https://uvm.mx/oferta-academica/diplomados-certificaciones/tecnologia-y-sistemas-en-linea-diplomados-y-certificaciones/diplomado-en-blockchain-y-sus-aplicaciones). See more [here](https://edurank.org/cs/cryptography/mx/).

**The gap:** Most programs focus on awareness over technical depth. Mexico lacks advanced protocol development or cryptography specializations comparable to Stanford or MIT programs, though student-led communities are filling this void through builder-focused events and hands-on learning.

## Challenges

- **MXN Stablecoin Liquidity**
    
    Multiple peso-pegged tokens exist (MXNB, MXNe, MXNT), but onchain depth and integrations are limited. Without liquid MXN pairs, remittances and DeFi rails stay USD-dominated.
    
- **Outdated Regulatory Framework**
    
    The 2018 Fintech Law doesn’t cover stablecoins, DeFi, or tokenization. Lack of clarity limits bank partnerships and institutional participation. Updates are needed to align with FATF and global standards.
    
- **Restricted Access to Payment Rails**
    
    SPEI, Mexico’s instant payment system, is crucial but heavily regulated. Most exchanges rely on partner PSPs instead of direct integration, slowing fiat on/off-ramps.
    
- **Fragmented Ecosystem & UX Friction**
    
    Liquidity is spread across L2s, wallets remain complex, and gas fees confuse new users.
    
- **Limited Institutional Connectors**
    
    Few professionals can bridge regulators, banks, government and DeFi builders. This slows pilot projects and policy alignment that could unlock larger adoption.
    

## **Conclusion**

Mexico's crypto ecosystem has evolved far beyond speculation, it's become critical financial infrastructure. The remittance corridor created the use case, stablecoins provided the rails, and L2s made it economically viable. What began as a workaround for expensive Western Union transfers is now a testing ground for the future of programmable money.

The next phase hinges on three catalysts: regulatory clarity that enables rather than restricts, MXN stablecoin liquidity that makes peso-denominated DeFi practical, and a maturing developer community that builds for local needs. Mexico isn't following the crypto playbook written elsewhere, it's writing its own, shaped by remittances, financial exclusion, and a generation that sees blockchain as infrastructure, not ideology.
