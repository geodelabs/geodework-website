# About

The story of Ethereum is a story of geography. Ethereum is a global network and global movement. It is local nodes spread around the world that give rise to the open source project that is the world computer. Ethereum is deeply rooted in geography. From grassroots communities and meetups to universities, from local developers to startups, from policy to user adoption and more, the vitality of Ethereum stems from the geographic decentralization of its ecosystem.

Geodework, a spin-out of the Ethereum Foundation, embodies this spirit. We are an ecosystem product studio dedicated to global Ethereum ecosystem development and as such building a better Internet. Geodework creates educational and community infra products and tools, facilitates grant giving, and executes on the work of global Ethereum ecodev.
